# @preact/compat - alias package

This package is intended to be used to resolve `react` to `preact/compat` via built-in features in npm, which requires a separate package to be used. Therefore this package just re-exports `preact/compat` as is.

To learn more about Preact itself, check out the main repo: https://github.com/preactjs/preact

## Usage

Run:

```bash
npm install react@npm:@preact/compat react-dom@npm:@preact/compat
```

See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) for more information about aliased installs.
